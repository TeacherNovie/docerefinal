    <h2>Meet Your Teacher</h2>
    <p>My name is Novie, your Science and English teacher. I am a passionate educator with a Bachelor’s degree in Secondary Education, majoring in General Science. In addition to my academic qualifications, I hold a TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) certificate, which has equipped me with specialized skills for teaching English to non-native speakers. Over the past three years, I have gained extensive experience in online teaching, where I have developed a keen understanding of effective virtual teaching strategies and tools. My background in general science, combined with my TEFL certification and online teaching experience, enables me to create engaging, informative, and interactive lessons that cater to diverse learning needs and environments. See you in my class and have a great day!</p>
